## Building

```sh
brew install xcodegen   # once — project.yml generates the .xcodeproj
make build               # Debug build, ad-hoc signed
make test                # unit tests
make run                 # build and launch
```

None of these need an Apple Developer account. `xcodebuild` ad-hoc signs a
Debug build automatically, which is enough to run and debug locally — the app
reads no keychain item, so there is no access grant for a changing signing
identity to invalidate.

`make release` is different: it archives, signs with a Developer ID
certificate, notarizes with Apple, and regenerates the Sparkle auto-update
feed. That's the maintainer's job for cutting an official build, and it needs
credentials only the maintainer has. You won't need it to contribute.

## Before opening a PR

- `make test` passes.
- New behavior has a test. `Tests/` mirrors `Sources/` by concern, not by
  file — look for the existing test class closest to what you're changing
  before adding a new one.
- If you're changing layout math in `Sources/Notch/NotchLayout.swift`, check it
  against `docs/design/frame-124-hover-tooltip.png` — every constant there is
  quoted from that frame in design-frame pixels via `Design.px(_:)`.

## Code style

- Comments explain **why**, not what — a hidden constraint, a bug a piece of
  code works around, a design decision that would otherwise look arbitrary.
  If removing a comment wouldn't confuse the next reader, it shouldn't be
  there.
- No premature abstraction. Three similar lines beat an early helper.
- A provider adapter (`Sources/Providers/`) should degrade every failure to a
  visible, honest status — `stale`, `needsAuth`, `accessDenied`, `error` — and
  never invent a number. See `UsageProviderError` and `ProviderStatus`.

## Adding a provider

Implement `UsageProvider` (`Sources/Providers/UsageProvider.swift`). At
minimum:

- Declare a `Fidelity` — `.official` if the number comes from the vendor's own
  endpoint or local state, `.derived` if you computed it yourself (the
  tooltip prefixes a `~`), `.manual` if it's a placeholder.
- Every failure path should map to a `ProviderStatus`, not throw something the
  UI can't render — see how `ClaudeCLIProvider` and `CodexLocalProvider`
  handle theirs.
- **Never add keychain access.** The app makes no keychain call at all today,
  and a new provider must not be the one to reintroduce one. Prefer running the
  vendor's own tool and letting it use its own credential — `ClaudeCLI`,
  `CodexBridge` and `AntigravityBridge` all do this. Cursor and GLM are the
  documented exceptions: they read a key their own tool wrote to a file,
  because neither vendor publishes a command that answers without one. Where a
  tool's output is prose rather than JSON, fail closed: a line you cannot parse
  is not a reading of zero.
- Say so when the tool isn't there. `UsageProviderError.unavailable` carries a
  sentence the card shows verbatim, and it drops the remembered reading —
  a number you can no longer re-read is one you should stop showing.

## Reporting a bug

Include the unified log around the time it happened:

```sh
/usr/bin/log show --last 10m --predicate 'subsystem == "com.vinz.codenotch"' --info --debug
```
